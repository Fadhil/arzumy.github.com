<p><small>Circa 1988</small></p>

My grandfather was a man with many talents. Everyone called him Cikgu (Teacher) because he's a retired teacher. Back then teachers are well respected in the community. People tend to listen to what he said. 

He's also a builder. He built the house we live in. A majestic 2-storey house on the bottom of the hill. In that sense you can also call him a carpenter. Or a maker. Since he made bunch of stuff all the times.

Once in a while he'll be a hunter. Walked into the woods for few days and when he's back we'll have a feast. Sometimes he'll walk around and shoot squirrels trying to steal the fruits.  

A bit later in life, I also known him as a businessman. He used to run a business with two or three branches. Making signboards or something like that.

But this is what I remember the most about him:

> Kita yang buat dia, bukan dia buat kita.
>
> (We made this, not the other way around.)


It was his favourite quote when he's facing a problem making or fixing stuff. He'll say that and start finding different ways to fix it. Nobody needs manual back then. When you don't know how something works, you'll just have to reverse engineer the damn thing and figure it out.

His quote will echo in my mind when I'm hacking on code. When I'm trying to make that piece of software behave the way I want it to behave, not the way it was intended to be. A human being wrote this code, another human being can change it. 

That is why, to me, my grandfather was truly a hacker.
